      <p><em>Information Systems Student at <strong> <a href="https://www.stcloudstate.edu/">SCSU</a></strong>.</em></p>
      <p>I attend Saint Cloud State University. I'm from Ethiopia, and I grew up with my aunt and cousins in the United States while my mother stayed back home to support our family. Fun facts about myself is that I moved to the United States when I was four years old. I'm also a self-taught coder who is currently studying on a daily basis. In my spare time, I enjoy coding and building projects. I also enjoy playing basketball with friends.
